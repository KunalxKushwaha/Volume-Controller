# Hey Hey Hey!!!!!!! 

So this baSically controls the volume on your Desktop or System through their Speakers or Bluetooth Connected Devices.<br>

While it’s a relatively simple utility, it showcases the power of combining AI, computer vision, and user-centric design. These technologies can lead to more intuitive, accessible, and contactless user experiences — something that's increasingly relevant in today’s tech landscape.<br>

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Real-time data processing

Human-computer interaction

System-level audio control

Modular code design and debugging under performance constraints


<h4>📈 Key Features Implemented</h4><br>
✔️ Smooth volume adjustment using finger distance
✔️ Visual volume bar and percentage overlay
✔️ Gesture thresholding for better control
✔️ Real-time hand landmark plotting
✔️ Lightweight, fast, and highly responsive
