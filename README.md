# 🖐🔊 Gesture-Based Volume Controller Using OpenCV & MediaPipe

A computer vision project that transforms your hand gestures into system volume controls — no physical interaction required.<br>

While it’s a relatively simple utility, it showcases the power of combining AI, computer vision, and user-centric design. These technologies can lead to more intuitive, accessible, and contactless user experiences — something that's increasingly relevant in today’s tech landscape.<br>

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Real-time data processing

Human-computer interaction

System-level audio control

Modular code design and debugging under performance constraints


<h4>📈 Key Features Implemented</h4><br>
✔️ Smooth volume adjustment using finger distance<br>
✔️ Visual volume bar and percentage overlay<br>
✔️ Gesture thresholding for better control<br>
✔️ Real-time hand landmark plotting<br>
✔️ Lightweight, fast, and highly responsive<br>
